class OpinionGrid:
    """
    A two-dimensional grid on which parties move.

    The opinion grid is where parties and voters are located. Its most important
    job is to calculate how many votes every party gets at its current position.

    The grid encodes the position of voters, specifically how many voters/how
    much weight each grid point/opinion has. For example, it can be a uniform
    distribution where each point has one vote, or a distribution with a maximum
    in the centre, etc. It is an abstraction of political views, like a
    political spectrum if it is limited to one dimension, or a political compass.
    The grid then assigns voters to a party based on which party is closets, and
    may also account for factors such as turnout or activists.

    Attributes:
        parties: List of Party objects on the grid.
        xGrid: Together with yGrid forms the grid by listing all coordinates in
               arrays, see ``numpy.meshgrid``.
        yGrid: See ``xGrid``.
        weight: Voter distribution, 2D array.

        Calculates the points closest to each party and adds their weight to the
        parties' vote count.

        The parties and voter distribution are properties of the grid.
        The parameters can be lists (such as the whole grid) in which case this
        method acts element-wise. `Usually`, x and y will be outputs of
        ``numpy.meshgrid``. This method modifies Party objects.

        Turnout is accounted for by reducing the given vote according to a
        polynomial (default inverse square) with distance from the party.

        Activists are accounted for by weighting the vote by distance from the
        origin. A positive number favours extremes, a negative number the centre.

        This method also sets the centre of the party's voters. This is the
        centre of each one's Voronoi polyhedral, weighted by votes, and is a
        property of the party.

        This method can cause runtime warnings if a party has no votes.

        ToDo: Also calculate real vote to be able to determine winners.
